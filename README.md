This is the code repository for [Machine Learning Security Principles](<Packtpub book link>?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=<13-P ISBN>), published by Packt.

**Use various methods to keep data, networks, users, and applications safe from prying eyes**

## What is this book about?
Machine learning is an important technology for getting more out of data today. Scientists use machine learning to discover new techniques or to create new kinds of data. Businesses use machine learning to detect credit card fraud, monitor networks, implement factory processes, and to achieve all sorts of other goals where humans and AI work side-by-side as explained in Part 1 of this book. Part 2 of this book covers all of the environments in which machine learning is commonly used and illustrates the security threats that plague them using code, graphics, and real world references.
Hackers don’t always damage or steal data, or use it to perform social attacks on a business. Sometimes they want money or other goods, and machine learning offers an avenue for acquiring them. A hacker may not steal anything at all—perhaps the target is someone’s reputation. Examples in Part 3 of this book show how to detect hacker behaviors in the modern computing environment.
Obtaining data in an ethical manner is important because the very act behaving ethically reduces the security risk associated with data. The simple act of removing Personally Identifiable Information (PII) from a dataset, as illustrated in Part 4 of this book, reduces the risk of social engineering attacks, while simultaneously keeping users safe.

This book covers the following exciting features: 
* Learn methods to detect and prevent illegal access to your system
* Discover detection techniques when access does occur
* Employ machine learning techniques to determine motivations
* Mitigate hacker access once security is breached
* Perform statistical measurement and behavior analysis
* Repair damage to your data and applications
* Use ethical data collection methods to reduce security risks

**Following is what you need for this book:**
Whether you’re a data scientist, researcher, or manager interested in machine learning techniques from various perspectives, you need this book because security has become a major headache for all three groups. Most resources are written by PhD candidates in a language that only they understand. This book presents security in a way that's easy to understand and employs a host of diagrams to explain concepts to visual learners. The book assumes that you're familiar with machine learning concepts and it helps if you already know a programming language, with an emphasis on Python knowledge.	

With the following software and hardware list you can run all code files present in the book (Chapter 1-12).
